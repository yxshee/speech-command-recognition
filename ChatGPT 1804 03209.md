1 Abstract

Describes an audio dataset[1] of spoken words de-
signed to help train and evaluate keyword spotting
systems. Discusses why this task is an interesting
challenge, and why it requires a specialized dataset
that’s diﬀerent from conventional datasets used for
automatic speech recognition of full sentences. Sug-
gests a methodology for reproducible and compara-
ble accuracy metrics for this task. Describes how
the data was collected and veriﬁed, what it contains,
previous versions[2] and properties. Concludes by
reporting baseline results of models trained on this
dataset.

2 Introduction

Speech recognition research has traditionally required
the resources of large organizations such as universi-
ties or corporations to pursue. People working in
those organizations usually have free access to either
academic datasets through agreements with groups
like the Linguistic Data Consortium[3], or to propri-
etary commercial data.

As speech technology has matured, the number of
people who want to train and evaluate recognition
models has grown beyond these traditional groups,
but the availability of datasets hasn’t widened. As
the example of ImageNet[4] and similar collections
in computer vision has shown, broadening access to

datasets encourages collaborations across groups and
enables apples-for-apples comparisons between diﬀer-
ent approaches, helping the whole ﬁeld move forward.
The Speech Commands dataset is an attempt to
build a standard training and evaluation dataset for
a class of simple speech recognition tasks. Its primary
goal is to provide a way to build and test small mod-
els that detect when a single word is spoken, from
a set of ten or fewer target words, with as few false
positives as possible from background noise or unre-
lated speech. This task is often known as keyword
spotting.

To reach a wider audience of researchers and devel-
opers, this dataset has been released under the Cre-
ative Commons BY 4.0 license[5]. This enables it to
easily be incorporated in tutorials and other scripts
where it can be downloaded and used without any
user intervention required (for example to register on
a website or email an administrator for permission).
This license is also well known in commercial set-
tings, and so can usually be dealt with quickly by
legal teams where approval is required.

LibriSpeech[7] is a collection of 1,000 hours of read

Its la-
bels are aligned at the sentence level only, thus lack-
ing word-level alignment information. This makes it
more suitable for full automatic speech recognition
than keyword spotting.

TIDIGITS[8] contains 25,000 digit sequences spo-
ken by 300 diﬀerent speakers, recorded in a quiet
room by paid contributors. The dataset is only
available under a commercial license from the Lan-
guage Data Consortium, and is stored in the NIST
SPHERE ﬁle format, which proved hard to decode
using modern software. Our initial experiments on
keyword spotting were performed using this dataset.
CHiME-5[9] has 50 hours of speech recorded in peo-
ple’s homes, stored as 16 KHz WAV ﬁles, and avail-
able under a restricted license.

4 Motivations

Many voice interfaces rely on keyword spotting to
start interactions. For example you might say "Hey
Google" or "Hey Siri"[10] to begin a query or com-
mand for your phone. Once the device knows that
you want to interact, it’s possible to send the audio
to a web service to run a model that’s only limited
by commercial considerations, since it can run on a
server whose resources are controlled by the cloud
provider. The initial detection of the start of an in-
teraction is impractical to run as a cloud-based ser-
vice though, since it would require sending audio data
over the web from all devices all the time. This would
be very costly to maintain, and would increase the
privacy risks of the technology.

Instead, most voice interfaces run a recognition
module locally on the phone or other device. This lis-
tens continuously to audio input from microphones,
and rather than sending the data over the internet to
a server, they run models that listen for the desired
trigger phrases. Once a likely trigger is heard, the

transfer of the audio to a web service begins. Because
the local model is running on hardware that’s not un-
der the web service provider’s control, there are hard
resource constraints that the on-device model has to
respect. The most obvious of these is that the mobile
processors typically present have total compute capa-
bilities that are much lower than most servers, so to
run in near real-time for an interactive response, on-
device models must require fewer calculations than
their cloud equivalents. More subtly, mobile devices
have limited battery lives and anything that is run-
ning continuously needs to be very energy eﬃcient
or users will ﬁnd their device is drained too quickly.
This consideration doesn’t apply to plugged-in home
devices, but those do have thermal constraints on
how much heat they can dissipate that restrict the
amount of energy available to local models, and are
encouraged by programs like EnergyStar to reduce
their overall power usage as much as possible. A ﬁ-
nal consideration is that users expect a fast response
from their devices, and network latency can be highly
variable depending on the environment, so some ini-
tial acknowledgement that a command was received
is important for a good experience, even if the full
server response is delayed.

These constraints mean that the task of keyword
spotting is quite diﬀerent to the kind of speech recog-
nition that’s performed on a server once an interac-
tion has been spotted:

• Keyword spotting models must be smaller and

involved less compute.

• They need to run in a very energy-eﬃcient way.

• Most of their input will be silence or background
noise, not speech, so false positives on those must
be minimized.

• Most of the input that is speech will be unrelated
to the voice interface, so the model should be
unlikely to trigger on arbitrary speech.

• The important unit of recognition is a single
word or short phrase, not an entire sentence.

These diﬀerences mean that the training and eval-
uation process between on-device keyword spotting

2

and general speech recognition models is quite dif-
ferent. There are some promising datasets to sup-
port general speech tasks, such as Mozilla’s Common
Voice, but they aren’t easily adaptable to keyword
spotting.

This Speech Commands dataset aims to meet the
special needs around building and testing on-device
models, to enable model authors to demonstrate the
accuracy of their architectures using metrics that are
comparable to other models, and give a simple way
for teams to reproduce baseline models by training
on identical data. The hope is that this will speed up
progress and collaboration, and improve the overall
quality of models that are available.

A second important audience is hardware manu-
facturers. By using a publicly-available task that
closely reﬂects product requirements, chip vendors
can demonstrate the accuracy and energy usage of
their oﬀerings in a way that’s easily comparable for
potential purchasers. This increased transparency
should result in hardware that better meets product
requirements over time. The models should also pro-
vide clear speciﬁcations that hardware engineers can
use to optimize their chips, and potentially suggest
model changes that make it easier to provide eﬃcient
implementations. This kind of co-design between ma-
chine learning and hardware can be a virtuous circle,
increasing the ﬂow of useful information between the
domains in a way that helps both sides.

5.1 Requirements

I made the decision to focus on capturing audio that
reﬂected the on-device trigger phrase task described
above. This meant that the use of studio-captured
samples seemed unrealistic, since that audio would
lack background noise, would be captured with high-
quality microphones, and in a formal setting. Suc-
cessful models would need to cope with noisy environ-
ments, poor quality recording equipment, and people
talking in a natural, chatty way. To reﬂect this, all
utterances were captured through phone or laptop
microphones, wherever users happened to be. The

one exception was that I asked them to avoid record-
ing themselves whenever there were background con-
versations happening for privacy reasons, so I asked
them to be in a room alone with the door closed.

I also decided to focus on English. This was for
pragmatic reasons, to limit the scope of the gather-
ing process and make it easier for native speakers to
perform quality control on the gathered data. I hope
that transfer learning and other techniques will still
make this dataset useful for other languages though,
and I open-sourced the collection application to al-
low others to easily gather similar data in other lan-
guages. I did want to gather as wide a variety of ac-
cents as possible however, since we’re familiar from
experience with the bias towards American English
in many voice interfaces.

Another goal was to record as many diﬀerent peo-
ple as I could. Keyword-spotting models are much
more useful if they’re speaker-independent, since the
process of personalizing a model to an individual re-
quires an intrusive user interface experience. With
this in mind, the recording process had to be quick
and easy to use, to reduce the number of people who
would fail to complete it.

I also wanted to avoid recording any personally-
identiﬁable information from contributors, since any
such data requires handling with extreme care for pri-
vacy reasons. This meant that I wouldn’t ask for any
attributes like gender or ethnicity, wouldn’t require a
sign-in through a user ID that could link to personal
data, and would need users to agree to a data-usage
agreement before contributing.

To simplify the training and evaluation process, I
decided to restrict all utterances to a standard dura-
tion of one second. This excludes longer words, but
the usual targets for keyword recognition are short so
this didn’t seem to be too restrictive. I also decided
to record only single words spoken in isolation, rather
than as part of a sentence, since this more closely re-
sembles the trigger word task we’re targeting. It also
makes labeling much easier, since alignment is not as
crucial.

5.2 Word Choice

I wanted to have a limited vocabulary to make sure
the capture process was lightweight, but still have
enough variety for models trained on the data to
potentially be useful for some applications.
I also
wanted the dataset to be usable in comparable ways
to common proprietary collections like TIDIGITS.
This led me to pick twenty common words as the
core of our vocabulary. These included the digits zero
to nine, and in version one, ten words that would
be useful as commands in IoT or robotics applica-
tions; "Yes", "No", "Up", "Down", "Left", "Right",
"On", "Oﬀ", "Stop", and "Go". In version 2 of the
dataset, I added four more command words; “Back-
ward”, “Forward”, “Follow”, and “Learn”. One of the
most challenging problems for keyword recognition
is ignoring speech that doesn’t contain triggers, so
I also needed a set of words that could act as tests
of that ability in the dataset. Some of these, such
as “Tree”, were picked because they sound similar to
target words and would be good tests of a model’s
discernment. Others were chosen arbitrarily as short
words that covered a lot of diﬀerent phonemes. The
ﬁnal list was "Bed", "Bird", "Cat", "Dog", "Happy",
"House", "Marvin", "Sheila", "Tree", and "Wow".

5.3 Implementation

To meet all these requirements, I created an open-
source web-based application that recorded utter-
ances using the WebAudioAPI[11]. This API is sup-
ported on desktop browsers like Firefox and Chrome,
It’s not available
and on Android mobile devices.
on iOS, which was considered to be unfortunate but
there were no alternatives that were more attractive.
I also looked into building native mobile applications
for iOS and Android, but I found that users were
reluctant to install them, for privacy and security
reasons. The web experience requires users to grant
permission to the website to access the microphone,
but that seemed a lot more acceptable, based on the
increased response rate. The initial test of the ap-
plication was hosted at an appspot.com subdomain,
but it was pointed out that teaching users to give mi-
crophone permissions to domains that were easy for

malicious actors to create was a bad idea. To address
this, the ﬁnal home of the application was moved to:

https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/

֒→ open_speech_recording

This is a known domain that’s controlled by Google,
and so it should be much harder to create confusing
spoofs of.

The initial page that a new user sees when navi-
gating to the application explains what the project is
doing, and asks them to explicitly and formally agree
to participating in the study. This process was de-
signed to ensure that the resulting utterances could
be freely redistributed as part of an open dataset, and
that users had a clear understanding of what the ap-
plication was doing. When a user clicks on “I Agree”,
a session cookie is added to record their agreement.
The recording portion of the application will only be
shown if this session cookie is found, and all upload
accesses are guarded by cross-site request forgery to-
kens, to ensure that only audio recorded from the
application can be uploaded, and that utterances are
from users who have agreed to the terms.

The recording page asks users to press a “Record”
button when they’re ready, and then displays a ran-
dom word from the list described above. The word
is displayed for 1.5 seconds while audio is recorded,
and then another randomly-chosen word is shown af-
ter a one-second pause. Each audio clip is added to a
list that’s stored locally on the client’s machine, and
they remain there until the user has ﬁnished record-
ing all words and has a chance to review them. The
random ordering of words was chosen to avoid pro-
nunciation changes that might be caused by repeti-
tion of the same word multiple times. Core words
are shown ﬁve times each in total, whereas auxiliary
words only appear once. There are 135 utterances
collected overall, which takes around six minutes in
total to run through completely. The user can pause
and restart at any point.

Once the recording process is complete, the user is
asked to review all of the clips, and if they’re happy
with them, upload them. This then invokes a web
API which uploads the audio to the server applica-
tion, which saves them into a cloud storage bucket.

4

The WebAudioAPI returns the audio data in OGG-
compressed format, and this is what gets stored in the
resulting ﬁles. The session ID is used as the preﬁx
of each ﬁle name, and then the requested word is fol-
lowed by a unique instance ID for the recording. This
session ID has been randomly generated, and is not
tied to an account or any other demographic informa-
tion, since none has been generated. It does serve as
a speaker identiﬁer for utterances however. To ensure
there’s a good distribution of diﬀerent speakers, once
a user has gone through this process once a cookie
is added to the application that ensures they can’t
access the recording page again.

To gather volunteers for this process, I used ap-
peals on social media to share the link and the aims
of the project. I also experimented with using paid
crowdsourcing for some of the utterances, though the
majority of the dataset comes from the open site.

5.4 Quality Control

The gathered audio utterances were of variable qual-
ity, and so I needed criteria to accept or reject sub-
missions. The informal guideline I used was that if
a human listener couldn’t tell what word was being
spoken, or it sounded like an incorrect word, then
the clip should be rejected. To accomplish this, I
used several layers of review.

To remove clips that were extremely short or quiet,
I took advantage of the nature of the OGG compres-
sion format. Compressed clips that contained very
little audio would be very small in size, so a good
heuristic was that any ﬁles that were smaller than 5
KB were unlikely to be correct. To implement this
rule, I used the following Linux shell command:

find ${BASEDIR}/oggs -iname "*.ogg" -size

֒→ -5k -delete

With that complete, I then converted the OGG
ﬁles into uncompressed WAV ﬁles containing PCM
sample data at 16KHz, since this is any easier format
for further processing:

find ${BASEDIR}/oggs -iname "*.ogg" -print0
֒→ | xargs -0 basename -s .ogg | xargs

֒→ -I {} ffmpeg -i ${BASEDIR}/oggs/{}.
֒→ ogg -ar 16000 ${BASEDIR}/wavs/{}.wav

Samples from other sources came as varying
sample-rate WAV ﬁles, so they were also resampled to
16 KHz WAV ﬁles using a similar ﬀmpeg command.

5.5 Extract Loudest Section

From manual inspection of the results, there were
still large numbers of utterances that were too quiet
or completely silent. The alignment of the spoken
words within the 1.5 second ﬁle was quite arbitrary
too, depending on the speed of the user’s response to
the word displayed. To solve both these problems,
I created a simple audio processing tool called Ex-
tract Loudest Section to examine the overall volume
of the clips. As a ﬁrst stage, I summed the absolute
diﬀerences of all the samples from zero (using a scale
where -32768 in the 16-bit sample data was -1.0 as
a ﬂoating-point number, and +32767 was 1.0), and
looked at the mean average of that value to estimate
the overall volume of the utterance. From experi-
mentation, anything below 0.004 on this metric was
likely to be to quiet to be intelligible, and so all of
those clips were removed.

To approximate the correct alignment, the tool
then extracted the one-second clip that contained the
highest overall volume. This tended to center the
spoken word in the middle of the trimmed clip, as-
suming that the utterance was the loudest part of
the recording. To run these processes, the following
commands were called:

git clone https://github.com/petewarden/
֒→ extract_loudest_section tmp/
֒→ extract_loudest_section
cd tmp/extract_loudest_section
make
cd ../..
mkdir -p ${BASEDIR}/trimmed_wavs
/tmp/extract_loudest_section/gen/bin/

֒→ extract_loudest_section ${BASEDIR}’/
֒→ wavs/*.wav’ ${BASEDIR}/trimmed_wavs/

5.6 Manual Review

These automatic processes caught technical problems
with quiet or silent recordings, but there were still
some utterances that were of incorrect words or were
unintelligible for other reasons. To ﬁlter these out I
turned to commercial crowdsourcing. The task asked
workers to type in the word they heard from each clip,
and gave a list of the expected words as examples.
Each clip was only evaluated by a single worker, and
any clips that had responses that didn’t match their
expected labels were removed from the dataset.

5.7 Release Process

The recorded utterances were moved into folders,
with one for each word. The original 16-digit hex-
adecimal speaker ID numbers from the web applica-
tion’s ﬁle names were hashed into 8-digit hexadecimal
IDs. Speaker IDs from other sources (like the paid
crowdsourcing sites) were also hashed into the same
format. This was to ensure that any connection to
worker IDs or other personally-identiﬁable informa-
tion was removed. The hash function used is stable
though, so in future releases the IDs for existing ﬁles
should remain the same, even as more speakers are
added.

5.8 Background Noise

A key requirement for keyword spotting in real prod-
ucts is distinguishing between audio that contains
speech, and clips that contain none. To help train
and test this capability, I added several minute-long
16 KHz WAV ﬁles of various kinds of background
noise. Several of these were recorded directly from
noisy environments, for example near running water
or machinery. Others were generated mathematically
using these commands in Python:

scipy.io.wavfile.write(’/tmp/white_noise.
֒→ wav’, 16000, np.array(((acoustics.
֒→ generator.noise(16000*60, color=’
֒→ white’))/3) * 32767).astype(np.int16
֒→ ))

scipy.io.wavfile.write(’/tmp/pink_noise.wav
֒→ ’, 16000, np.array(((acoustics.

֒→ generator.noise(16000*60, color=’
֒→ pink’))/3) * 32767).astype(np.int16)
֒→ )

To distinguish these ﬁles

from word utter-
they were placed in a specially-named
in the root of the

ances,
"_background_noise_" folder,
archive.

6 Properties

The ﬁnal dataset consisted of 105,829 utterances of
35 words, broken into the categories and frequencies
shown in Table 1.

Each utterance is stored as a one-second (or less)
WAVE format ﬁle, with the sample data encoded as
linear 16-bit single-channel PCM values, at a 16 KHz
rate. There are 2,618 speakers recorded, each with
a unique eight-digit hexadecimal identiﬁer assigned
as described above. The uncompressed ﬁles take up
approximately 3.8 GB on disk, and can be stored as
a 2.7GB gzip-compressed tar archive.

7 Evaluation

One of this dataset’s primary goals is to enable mean-
ingful comparisons between diﬀerent models’ results,
so it’s important to suggest some precise testing pro-
tocols. As a starting point, it’s useful to specify ex-
actly which utterances can be used for training, and
which must be reserved for testing, to avoid over-
ﬁtting. The dataset download includes a text ﬁle
called validation_list.txt, which contains a list
of ﬁles that are expected to be used for validating re-
sults during training, and so can be used frequently to
help adjust hyperparameters and make other model
changes. The testing_list.txt ﬁle contains the
names of audio clips that should only be used for mea-
suring the results of trained models, not for training
or validation. The set that a ﬁle belongs to is chosen
using a hash function on its name. This is to en-
sure that ﬁles remain in the same set across releases,
even as the total number changes, so avoid set cross-
contamination when trying old models on the more
recent test data. The Python implementation of the

7.1 Top-One Error

The simplest metric to judge a trained model against
is how many utterances it can correctly identify. In
principle this can be calculated by running the model
against all the ﬁles in the testing set, and comparing
the reported against the expected label for each. Un-
like image classiﬁcation tasks like ImageNet, it’s not
obvious how to weight all of the diﬀerent categories.
For example, I want a model to indicate when no
speech is present, and separately to indicate when it
thinks a word has been spoken that’s not one it rec-
ognizes. These “open world” categories need to be
weighted according to their expected occurrence in
a real application to produce a realistic metric that
reﬂects the perceived quality of the results in a prod-
uct.

The standard chosen for the TensorFlow speech
commands example code is to look for the ten words
"Yes", "No", "Up", "Down", "Left", "Right", "On",
"Oﬀ", "Stop", and "Go", and have one additional
special label for “Unknown Word”, and another for
“Silence” (no speech detected). The testing is then
done by providing equal numbers of examples for
each of the twelve categories, which means each class
accounts for approximately 8.3% of the total. The
"Unknown Word" category contains words randomly
sampled from classes that are part of the target
set. The "Silence" category has one-second clips ex-
tracted randomly from the background noise audio
ﬁles.

I’ve uploaded a standard set of test ﬁles[13] to make
it easier to reproduce this metric. If you want to cal-
culate the canonical Top-One error for a model, run
inference on each audio clip, and compare the top pre-
dicted class against the ground truth label encoded
in its containing subfolder name. The proportion of
correct predictions will give you the Top-One error.
There’s also a similar collection of test ﬁles[14] avail-
able for version one of the dataset.

The example training code that accompanies the
dataset[15] provides results of 88.2% on this met-
ric for the highest-quality model when fully trained.
This translates into a model that qualitatively gives
a reasonable, but far from perfect response, so it’s
expected that this will serve as a baseline to be ex-

ceeded by more sophisticated architectures.

7.2 Streaming Error Metrics

Top-One captures a single dimension of the perceived
quality of the results, but doesn’t reveal much about
other aspects of its performance in a real application.
For example, models in products receive a continuous
stream of audio data and don’t know when words
start and end, whereas the inputs to Top One eval-
uations are aligned to the beginning of utterances.
The equal weighting of each category in the overall
score also doesn’t reﬂect the distribution of trigger
words and silence in typical environments.

To measure some of these more complex properties
of models, I test them against continuous streams of
audio and score them on multiple metrics. Here’s
what the baseline model trained with V2 data pro-
duces:

49.0% matched, 46.0% correctly, 3.0%
֒→ wrongly, 0.0% false positives

To produce this result, I ran the following bash
script against the 10 minute streaming test audio clip
and ground truth labels:

bazel run tensorflow/examples/

֒→ speech_commands:freeze -- --
֒→ start_checkpoint=/tmp/
֒→ speech_commands_train/conv.ckpt
֒→ -18000 --output_file=/tmp/
֒→ v2_frozen_graph.pb
bazel run tensorflow/examples/

֒→ speech_commands:
֒→ test_streaming_accuracy -- --graph=/
֒→ tmp/v2_frozen_graph.pb --wav=/tmp/
֒→ speech_commands_train/streaming_test
֒→ .wav --labels=/tmp/
֒→ speech_commands_train/conv_labels.
֒→ txt --ground_truth=/tmp/
֒→ speech_commands_train/
֒→ streaming_test_labels.txt

were correctly identiﬁed, within a given time tol-
erance.

• Wrong-percentage shows how many words were
correctly distinguished as speech rather than
background noise, but were given the wrong class
label.

• False-positive percentage is the number of words
detected that were in parts of the audio where
no speech was actually present.

is

Performing successfully on these metrics requires
more than basic template recognition of audio clips.
There has to be at least a very crude set of rules to
suppress repeated recognitions of the same word in
short time frames, so default logic for this is imple-
mented in recognize_commands.cc[17].

This allows a simple template-style recognition
model to be used directly to generate these statis-
tics. One of the other conﬁgurable features of the
accuracy test is the time tolerance for how close to
the ground truth’s time a recognition result must be
to count as a match. The default for this is set to
750ms, since that seems to match with requirements
for some of the applications that are supported.

To make reproducing and comparing results easier,
I’ve made available a one-hour audio ﬁle[18] contain-
ing a mix of utterances at random times and noise, to-
gether with a text ﬁle marking the times and ground
truth labels of each utterance. This was generated
using the script included in the TensorFlow tutorial,
and can be used to compare diﬀerent models perfor-
mance on streaming applications.

7.3 Historical Evaluations

Version 1 of the dataset[2] was released August 3rd
2017, and contained 64,727 utterances from 1,881
speakers. Training the default convolution model
from the TensorFlow tutorial (based on Convolu-
tional Neural Networks for Small-footprint Keyword
Spotting[19]) using the V1 training data gave a Top-
One score of 85.4%, when evaluated against the test
set from V1. Training the same model against ver-
sion 2 of the dataset[1], documented in this paper,

produces a model that scores 88.2% Top-One on the
training set extracted from the V2 data. A model
trained on V2 data, but evaluated against the V1
test set gives 89.7% Top-One, which indicates that
the V2 training data is responsible for a substantial
improvement in accuracy over V1. The full set of
results are shown in Table 2.

Figure 2: Top-One accuracy evaluations using diﬀer-
ent training data

These ﬁgures were produced using the checkpoints

produced by the following training commands:

python tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/
֒→ train.py --data_url=\protect\vrule
֒→ width0pt\protect\href{http://
֒→ download.tensorflow.org/data/
֒→ speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz}{http
֒→ ://download.tensorflow.org/data/
֒→ speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz}

python tensorflow/examples/speech_commands/
֒→ train.py --data_url=\protect\vrule
֒→ width0pt\protect\href{http://
֒→ download.tensorflow.org/data/
֒→ speech_commands_v0.02.tar.gz}{http
֒→ ://download.tensorflow.org/data/
֒→ speech_commands_v0.02.tar.gz}

The results of these commands are available as pre-
trained checkpoints[20]. The evaluations were per-
formed by running variations on the following com-
mand line (with the v1/v2’s substituted as appropri-
ate):

֒→ start_checkpoint=${HOME}/
֒→ speech_commands_checkpoints/conv-v
֒→ {1,2}.ckpt-18000

7.4 Applications

The TensorFlow tutorial gives a variety of baseline
models, but one of the goals of the dataset is to en-
able the creation and comparison of a wide range of
models on a lot of diﬀerent platforms, and version one
of has enabled some interesting applications. CMSIS-
NN[21] covers a new optimized implementation of
neural network operations for ARM microcontrollers,
and uses Speech Commands to train and evaluate the
results. Listening to the World[22] demonstrates how
combining the dataset and UrbanSounds[23] can im-
prove the noise tolerance of recognition models. Did
you Hear That[24] uses the dataset to test adversar-
ial attacks on voice interfaces. Deep Residual Learn-
ing for Small Footprint Keyword Spotting[25] shows
how approaches learned from ResNet can produce
more eﬃcient and accurate models. Raw Waveform-
based Audio Classiﬁcation[26] investigates alterna-
tives to traditional feature extraction for speech and
music models. Keyword Spotting Through Image
Recognition[27] looks at the eﬀect virtual adversarial
training on the keyword task.

8 Conclusion

The Speech Commands dataset has shown to be use-
ful for training and evaluating a variety of models,
and the second version shows improved results on
equivalent test data, compared to the original.
